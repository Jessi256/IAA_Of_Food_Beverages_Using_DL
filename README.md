# Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) of food and beverages using deep learning

To support the research and applications that are related to image aesthetics assessment (IAA) of food and beverages, the main contributions of this repository are two-fold:

<ul>
  <li>Introduction of the brand-new dataset for food and beverage images RIAA.</li>
  <li>A systematic evaluation of how far a deep learning system can be used to learn the aesthetics of food and beverage images that reflect the taste of laypersons or experts in the field. Therefore, several test cases on RIAA are defined along the typical flow for IAA. These test cases are conducted using simple baseline models that are competitive with the current state-of-the-art models.</li>

<h2>Background</h1>

In recent years, a rapid growth of digital presentation and manipulation of food and beverages in online content has occurred [1–4]. This is due to growing interest in “foodporn” and “gastroporn” [5] as well as a growing attention in the visual presentation of products by marketers and advertisers [1, 6, 7]. According to statistics from the rise of Instagram, almost 85 percent of the images on its social media site are related to food [8]. Additionally, there are more than 853 million images associated with the hashtags “food”, “beverage”, “foodporn”, and “foodblogger” [9]. Consequently, identifying aesthetic food and beverage images is an important visual analysis task for social media and ranking systems that are related to food. The image aesthetics assessment (IAA) aims to distinguish aesthetic, high-quality images from unaesthetic, low-quality ones with the use of binary classification or scoring. Nevertheless, IAA of food and beverage images remains a challenging and relatively unexplored area in terms of deep learning. This is due to the lack of food and beverage image datasets and practical experience [10].

<h2>RIAA: Recipe Image Aesthetics Assessment</h1>
RIAA is a brand-new, self-created and large-scale dataset for aesthetics assessment of food and beverage images. Compared to the existing food and beverage aesthetics dataset <a href="https://github.com/Openning07/GPA">GPD </a>, this dataset has a more diverse label annotation process, including annotations made from over 100 laypersons. This ensures a more diverse representation of labels and eliminates the bias that can come from a single annotator. 20,800 food and beverage images are collected with layperson-annotated labels (i.e., aesthetically positive, neutral, or negative) to build this dataset.
